10 Ways To Improve UI

1) Adding Tab Order To Fields
/ This is important because desktop users like to use their keyboards to fill a form fast.

2) Submitting A Form On Enter
/ This is part of a good User Interface since keyboard users will stick to using Enter instead of the mouse.

3) Blocking A Page On Requests or Background Activity
/ When user are running a search it is always good to an overlay with a progress symbol to prevent the user from doing further requests which might end up crashing the system.

4) Informing Users Of What's Going On
/ When running a search or uploading a file it is always a good idea to add a loading spinner or pogress bar that lets users know what's going on. Personalized messages can also be added to give a more pleasant design.

5) Having A Responsive Page

6) Avoiding Unnecessary Elements
/ Sometimes social media logins make their way into our pages when there's no need for them. Examples of this include, but are not limited to:
- Facebook/Twitter/Google Login.
- User Profile Picture Icon
